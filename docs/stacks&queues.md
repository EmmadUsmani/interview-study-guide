# Stacks & Queues

Stacks are FILO (first-in, last-out) while queues are FIFO (first-in, first-out).
Both can be implemented using linked lists (deque in Python), and only a stack can be implemented using an array.


## Runtime Complexity
Complexity depends on the underlying data structure. Generally, supported operations (insertion, deletion, peeking) will be constant time.


## Techniques
Stacks are often useful in backtracking algorithms.

Queues are used for breadth-first search and  often for implementing caches.
