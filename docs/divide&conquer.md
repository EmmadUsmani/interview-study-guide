# Divide-and-Conquer

Divide-and-conquer is a strategy for solving a problem by:
1. Breaking it into subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. Recursively solving these subproblems.
3. Appropriately combining their answers.


The most notable divide-and-conquer algorithms are Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, and Quick Select.

The runtime of a divide-and-conquer algorithm can be derived using the [Master Theorm.](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap2.pdf#page=4)
