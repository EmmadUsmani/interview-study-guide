# Strings

## Runtime Complexity
Strings are essentially arrays of characters, so their runtime complexity is the same. In Java, be aware of the differences between String and StringBuilder. *(CTCI pg 90)*

## Techniques
As with arrays, general types of algorithms work on strings, since they are indeed arrays. Again, Sliding Window / Multiple pointer is very useful.
