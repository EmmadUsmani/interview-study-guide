## Backtracking
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for finding solutions to problems by incremently building a candidate solution, and abandoning it ("backtracking") as soon as it is determined that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Many recursive / dynamic programming algorithms are instances of backtracking.
